## 🔍 Phase 3 Review & Fixes (2026-02-08)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Critical Fixes Applied
- [x] Fixed `SPC g p` keybinding conflict (git push vs prev hunk)
  - Removed duplicate `SPC g n`/`SPC g p` bindings
  - Kept `[g`/`]g` for git hunk navigation (cleaner, vim-style)
- [x] Re-enabled LSP hover provider
  - Removed `eglot-ignored-server-capabilities` that broke `K` keybinding
  - LSP hover docs now work properly
- [x] Added graceful degradation for Claude Code
  - Added `:if (executable-find "claude")` check
  - Config won't break if Claude CLI not installed

### Documentation Added
- [x] Created **REVIEW.md** - Full configuration audit (issues, recommendations, testing checklist)
- [x] Created **SETUP.md** - System dependencies guide (tools, LSP servers, fonts, troubleshooting)

### Overall Assessment
**Score:** 8/10 → **9/10** (after fixes)

The configuration is production-ready! Main issues resolved:
- Conflicting keybindings fixed
- LSP functionality restored
- Dependency handling improved
- Comprehensive documentation added

**Ready for:** Daily use or Phase 4 expansion
